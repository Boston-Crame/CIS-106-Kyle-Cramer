I'm taking computer logic and programming technology at Harper college 

I'm interested in the class because computers have been a passion of mine but programming has always been intimidating to me. I'm the usual go to IT person in the house, wish I was paid for it. Currently I'm going into nursing but in the back of my head I've always wanted to try and get into programming. I know very basic python and JavaScript but it's been years since I last practiced. Back then I was not confident and intimidated by programming. I'm also bad at math so I thought I could never do it. I know not all programming is math though and a part of me misses the problem solving that came with math. It's a different kind than nursing and it's been a itch on my back I could never scratch. The creativity and freedom of trying to solve a problem. I figured before I go 100% into nursing I would like to try a programming class once, to test the waters and to see if it will scratch that itch I can never seem to reach
